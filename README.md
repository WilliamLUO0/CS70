# CS705-D1 project
Group 3 (Zihao Luo, Ziqi Wang,Yashi Lin,Yidan Zhang,Yiwen Zhang,Wenxu Wang)

##  Project background
The realistic task/interface needs to related to our daily life and it has to be a repeated sequence. Nowadays, people did mostly everything online,so we decided to developed an online food ordering website which people are familiared with and we applied Fitt's law to the interface. In order to let university students get to learn the main idea of Fitt's law.
We assumed students with HCI course background to read and try out our activities.Our research question is : "Does the process of involving students in realistic interface design and iterative testing with performance feedback promotes students’ understanding of Fitt's Law?" Therefore,we established a pre-test and a post-test for all the users to check how well they learn and whether they improved their knowledge during the process.Our project followed the project plan.
